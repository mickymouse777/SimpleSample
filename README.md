# SimpleSample

This is a sample application showing the inclusion of an Azure Function call into the TableStorageService of an MVC web application.

Please note that for simplicity I have updated the Service to include the changes from a straight add name.

The original code is commented out in the controller.

This is designed as a simple sample to show how to include Azure Functions into an existing Web app.

Function1 is included in the files here but should be published to a separate function app from its own project
